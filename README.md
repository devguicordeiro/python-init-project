I'm creating this project because my main focus will be getting into ml
</br>
so I'll be practcing lots of python and data stuff, not only webdev
</br>
here will be located all my python small projects ill be working on while practicing basics
</br>
each folder bellow will contain one small project, after concluding these, we'll move to autoral projects (lmaos)
